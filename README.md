JavaScript Swipe Cards
=============================

This is a proof of concept card swiping experience. You can loop between three cards infinitely by swiping or dragging in either direction. The goal was to make a smooth experience that matched the kind of interation quality you'd expect in a native app.

Since this is a proof of concept, it's only limited to three cards. I plan on iterating on this to add true infinite scrolling through cards, handling memory usage by adding and removing card elements from the DOM when off screen.

This kind of interaction would work well for a news reader (a la Flipboard), or multiple screens of related content.
